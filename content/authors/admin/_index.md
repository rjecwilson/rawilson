I work on projects from concept through deployment using system engineering principles, component testing, multi-scale test programs, and system acceptance testing to help solve difficult environmental challenges. I enjoy using {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}}, data visualization and reproducible data analysis to communicate complex concepts across a broad range of groups, including scientists, engineers, regulators, stakeholders and decision makers.

I am a lifelong fan of football --- the global version where players use their feet more than their hands --- and have been known to rise well before dawn to watch a match played halfway around the world.
